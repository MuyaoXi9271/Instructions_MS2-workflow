# MS2 preprocessing targeted
Please copy the template of excel file which fits your data `LCMS_library_template1.xlsx` or `LCMS_library_template2.xlsx` under the folder `J:\CBMR\SUN-CBMR-Metabolomics\Workflow\utils\utils_MS2_preprocessing\LCMS_library_template.xlsx` and fill in the information related to the standards which you would like to preprocess. You must fill the columns with the column name in red color. Regarding the filled filenames, they are without extension




## XCMS_check retention time
Check if the retention time of each standard from MS2 is similar to that from MS1

The script `2b.Pipeline_XCMS_checkRT.R` is available under the folder of `J:\CBMR\SUN-CBMR-Metabolomics\Workflow\Script\modules\MS2_preprocessing`

### Filename for containing information of standards including absolute path (Please fill in the provided template) as well as indicating "T1" or "T2" ðŸ•µ

- If each sample includes all the same standards, sheet **T1** is suggested to filled in (at least the red names of columns) and put all filenames in the sheet **T1_Filenames**.

- If each sample includes different standards, sheet **T2** is suggested to filled in (at least the red names of columns)
