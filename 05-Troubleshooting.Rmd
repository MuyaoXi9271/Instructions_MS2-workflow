# FTP (transfer local files to server of GNPS)
| 1. When upload files via FTP, meet the error "Unrecognized CURL options: connectiontimeout" 

| **Solution**: wait for a while and run the codes again. Or try to open the software "WinSCP" to see whether it works manually.



# Download files from GNPS platform
| 1. Warning: cannot open file 'xx.zip': No such file or directory Error in file(file.path(outputs_folder, paste0(workflow, ".zip")), "wb") : cannot open the connection
| **Solution**: 1. assign $download_path$ with C/: drive instead H/: or J/: drive
                2. or remove "recursive = TRUE"
